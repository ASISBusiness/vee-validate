## Quick Setup

<br />

### Installation

```sh
# install with yarn
yarn add vee-validate

# install with npm
npm install vee-validate --save
```

Or use a CDN

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vee-validate"></script>
```

### Usage

Register the `Field` and `Form` components and create a simple `required` validator:

```js
import { Field, Form } from 'vee-validate';

export default {
  components: {
    Field,
    Form,
  },
  methods: {
    // Validator function
    isRequired(value) {
      return value ? true : 'This field is required';
    },
  },
};
```

Then use the `Form` and `Field` components to render your form:

```vue-html
<Form v-slot="{ errors }">
  <Field name="field" :rules="isRequired" />

  <span>{{ errors.field }}</span>
</Form>
```
